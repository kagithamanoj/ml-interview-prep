```

## Core Topics

- **Math Foundations**: Linear algebra (SVD, PCA), probability (Bayes, MLE/MAP), and statistics (bias-variance).
- **Algorithms**: Regression, tree-based methods, SVMs, CNNs, Transformers, and LoRA fine-tuning.
- **System Design**: Frameworks for recommendation systems, fraud detection, and enterprise RAG.
- **Coding**: From-scratch implementations of Linear/Logistic Regression, KNN, and K-Means.

## Usage

The coding implementations are designed to be self-contained and interpreted with standard Python:

```bash
# Execute coding examples
python coding/python-ml-coding.py
```

Refer to `docs/study-guide.md` for a recommended progression through these materials.
