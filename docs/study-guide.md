## Recommended Study Order

### Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1–2)
1. **Linear Algebra** → `fundamentals/linear-algebra.md`
   - Focus: Eigenvalues, SVD, norms, matrix operations
2. **Probability & Statistics** → `fundamentals/probability-statistics.md`
   - Focus: Bayes, distributions, bias-variance, hypothesis testing

### Phase 2: Algorithms (Week 3–4)
3. **Supervised Learning** → `algorithms/supervised.md`
   - Focus: Logistic regression, trees, SVMs, ensembles
4. **Deep Learning** → `algorithms/deep-learning.md`
   - Focus: Backprop, CNNs, Transformers, LoRA

### Phase 3: Applied (Week 5–6)
5. **System Design** → `system-design/ml-system-design.md`
   - Focus: End-to-end ML system design framework
6. **Coding** → `coding/python-ml-coding.py`
   - Practice: Implement algorithms from scratch in Python

### Phase 4: Review (Week 7)
7. **Cheat Sheets** → `cheatsheets/ml-cheatsheet.md`
   - Quick reference for exam day / interview prep

## Study Tips

- **Active recall**: Read a question, try to answer before looking
- **Implement from scratch**: The `coding/` folder has runnable implementations
- **Explain out loud**: Practice explaining concepts as if teaching
- **Draw diagrams**: Especially for system design and architectures
- **Time yourself**: System design should be 30–45 minutes
